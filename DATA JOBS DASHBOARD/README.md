## Introduction

Understanding the data job market can be challenging, job postings are spread across multiple platforms, role titles vary widely, and salary information is often inconsistent or difficult to compare. This Power BI dashboard was created to bring clarity to that complexity by consolidating key job market insights into a single, interactive experience.

Using a real-world dataset of **data science job postings from 2023 to July 2025** (including job titles, salaries, and locations) provided by **Luke Barousse** in his [Power BI Course](https://www.lukebarousse.com/powerbi), this dashboard enables users to explore hiring demand, compensation trends, and role-specific patterns across the global data job landscape.


Designed with **job seekers, career switchers, and early-career data professionals** in mind, the dashboard allows users to move seamlessly from high-level market trends to detailed, job-specific insights. At the same time, this project served as a practical opportunity for me to apply and strengthen my Power BI skills by building a clean, interactive, and insight-driven analytical report.

## Skills Demonstrated

This project provided hands-on experience across the full workflow of building an interactive Power BI dashboard—from raw data preparation to final presentation. Key skills demonstrated include:

- **⚙️ Data Transformation (ETL) with Power Query**  
  Cleaned and prepared the raw job posting data by handling missing values, correcting data types, and creating additional calculated columns to support analysis.

- **🧮 Measures & KPIs**  
  Created measures to calculate key metrics such as total job count, median yearly salary, median hourly salary, and salary-based indicators used across the dashboard.

- **📊 Data Visualisation**  
  Designed and implemented a range of visuals including bar charts, column charts, line and area charts, scatter plots, KPI cards, and tables to effectively communicate trends and comparisons.

- **🗺️ Geospatial Analysis**  
  Used map visuals to display the global distribution of data jobs, helping users understand regional hiring patterns.

- **🎨 Dashboard Design & Layout**  
  Applied a clean, modern dark theme with a strong visual hierarchy to ensure readability, consistency, and an intuitive user experience.

- **🖱️ Interactivity & Navigation**  
  Enhanced the report with interactive features such as:
  - Slicers for filtering by job title  
  - Buttons and bookmarks for smooth page navigation  
  - Drill-through functionality to move from a high-level overview to detailed, job-specific insights  

## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard is structured into **two pages**, each designed to serve a specific analytical purpose—providing both a high-level market summary and a detailed, role-specific deep dive.

### Page 1: High-Level Market Overview

This page acts as the main entry point to the dashboard, offering a snapshot of the overall data job market. It highlights key performance indicators such as total job postings, median yearly and hourly salaries, and trends over time.

Users can quickly compare demand and compensation across different data roles, identify salary patterns, and gain a broad understanding of how the market is evolving. The layout is designed to be visually clear and easy to interpret, enabling fast insight generation at a glance.

### Page 2: Job Title Drill-Through Analysis

The second page is a dedicated drill-through view that allows users to explore detailed insights for a selected job title directly from the main dashboard.

This page includes information such as salary ranges, job type distribution, work-from-home availability, top hiring platforms, degree mentions, and health insurance indicators, along with a global map showing job locations. This focused view supports deeper analysis and enables more informed comparisons between specific roles.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Power BI can be used to transform raw job posting data into meaningful, interactive insights. By combining data cleaning, analytical measures, thoughtful visual design, and interactivity, the dashboard provides a clear and structured view of the data job market.

Beyond the insights themselves, this project represents a valuable step in strengthening my Power BI and data analysis skills. It reflects my ability to design an end-to-end analytical report that supports real-world decision-making and delivers insights in a clear, user-focused manner particularly for individuals exploring or navigating a career in data.
