## 📌 Introduction

Understanding the data job market can be challenging — job postings are scattered across platforms, role definitions vary, and salary information is often inconsistent.

**Data Jobs Dashboard 2.0** was built to simplify this complexity by consolidating real-world job market data into a **single, focused, and interactive Power BI report**.

Using a real-world dataset of data science job postings from **2023 to June 2025**, this dashboard helps job seekers, career transitioners, and data professionals quickly understand:

- Which data roles are in demand  
- Which skills matter most  
- How compensation varies across roles and regions  

This version represents a significant upgrade over **Dashboard 1.0**, incorporating structured Power Query transformations, explicit DAX measures, improved UX design, and dynamic metric switching.
